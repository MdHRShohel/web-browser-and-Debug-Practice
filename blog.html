                localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even
                if the domain is opened in a new tab, or the browser is closed and
                reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                You can access local Storage using the window object. myStorage =
                window.localStorage;
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                The setItem() method takes a key name and a value as arguments. It
                will then add the key/value pair to the Storage object. If the key
                already exists, it will update the key’s value.
                window.localStorage.setItem(keyName, keyValue);
              </li>

              <li>
                sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page
                session lasts as long as the tab or the browser is open.
                Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a
                new session and new storage.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                You can access session Storage using the window object. myStorage
                = window.sessionStorage;
              </li>

        <h1 class="question">Difference between Global scope and block scope</h1>
        <div class="answer">
        <div class="part">
          <h2>Global Scope</h2>
          <ol>
            <br>
            <li>
              The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets
              are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope
              means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
              program, any function or conditional state can access that
              variable.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              For example: var name = "linuxHint"; function printName(){ // the
              variable can be accessed inside here console.log("This tutorial is
              by "+name); } printName();
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="part">
          <h2>Block Scope</h2>
          <ol>
            <br>
            <li>
              Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can
              be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets
              {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional
              statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to
              these variables from within the curly brackets {}.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              For example: A block of code enclosed with curly brackets{}
              containing some block variables. { let a = 10; const b = 5; } This
              block of code is itself inside a function. function addition() { {
              let a = 10; const b = 5; } }
            </li>
          </ol>

        <h1 class="question">How event loop work on javascript?</h1>
        <p>
          The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the
          Event Loop.

        <h1 class="question">How can we get undefined in javascript?</h1>
        <p>
          Undefined is a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it. So you can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value.
